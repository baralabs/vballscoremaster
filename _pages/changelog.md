# **Version 4.1** <br>
***Beautiful new look!***

#### What's New
- Redesigned for today's iPhones and iPads. New look with the same features you've always used and loved.
- Allows for one-handed use. No more rotating your device just to use the app!
- The score and settings buttons are moved to the bottom of the screen. It's now easier for you to use and enjoy.
- Dark mode look fantastic, especially on the new iPhones.

Due to changes made in iOS, I had to remove the ability to create screenshots and share them on Twitter and Facebook. I'm working to add these features back into the app in a future update.

### `Big Update!`
# **Version 3.4**
This is a big update! The #1 most requested new feature has been added to VBall ScoreMaster.
You can now add your own Action Names! The feedback was overwhelming, you wanted to be able to add and edit Action Names....now you can! Simply swipe on an Action Name and you'll see buttons that allow you to rename, add, or delete. Very simple and very effective.

This version also makes the move to iOS 9. The app no longer supports, nor can it be run on, any iPhone or iPad lower than iOS 9. Our analytics tell us that almost 100% of our users are already on iOS 9. If you're not on iOS 9, you need to be to run this version. This had to be done to take advantage of the exciting new features that Apple has built-in to the system.

Thank you to all our customers who sent us feedback within the app. It's because of you that development of VBall ScoreMaster continues while other scoring apps have been abandoned long ago.

Don't forget that every new version pushes existing reviews into the background. Please help others find this app, just like you did, by leaving a review. If you support or have questions, please don't leave that in a review, contact BaraLabs using 'Contact the Developer' on the Support screen in the app.

#### What's New
