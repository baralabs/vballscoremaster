### `Latest`
# **Version 4.2** <br>

**All new support for iOS 13!**

Don't forget to leave your review of the app and help other users and families discover the best volleyball scoreboard in the App Store!

Several improvements have been made in this version:
- Support for iOS Dark Mode on iPhone and iPad. The app will automatically follow your Dark Mode settings, no need to change the colors in the Setting tab anymore! Vibrant colors and deep blacks looks fantastic on the new screens.
- Removed all Google analytics.
- Bugs quashed leaving the app leaner and faster than ever before!

# **Version 4.1** <br>
***Beautiful new look!***

- Redesigned for today's iPhones and iPads. New look with the same features you've always used and loved.
- Allows for one-handed use. No more rotating your device just to use the app!
- The score and settings buttons are moved to the bottom of the screen. It's now easier for you to use and enjoy.
- Dark mode look fantastic, especially on the new iPhones.
- New team color picker for easier selection.

Due to changes made in iOS, I had to remove the ability to create screenshots and share them on Twitter and Facebook. I'm working to add these features back into the app in a future update.

Another big update for VBall ScoreMaster! First, thanks to everyone who continues to use the app, it's because of you that we're the #1 volleyball scoring app in the App Store! VBall ScoreMaster continues to innovate and update while other scoring apps have been abandoned long ago.

Don't forget that every new version pushes existing reviews into the background. Please help others find this app, just like you did, by leaving a review. If you support or have questions, please don't leave that in a review, contact BaraLabs using 'Contact the Developer' on the Support screen in the app.

Here's a list of what's changed with this update:
- Updates to messages. Decide if you want to send a message or post to social media with either your player info, the team score, or blank.
- Support for 3D Touch!
-Start a new game or match using 3D Touch on the home screen icon. Change Action Names from the main screen, no more going into Settings just to change the name.
- 3D Touch the VBall on the main screen to select your message type.
- Have you ever started counting your player's Actions and then decided to change Action Names? After you change names you see that the counter is still counting the old Action. Now you can long-press the Action Name count and reset it to zero!
- Faster, leaner, and looks great!

3.4Nov 20, 2015
This is a big update! The #1 most requested new feature has been added to VBall ScoreMaster.
You can now add your own Action Names! The feedback was overwhelming, you wanted to be able to add and edit Action Names....now you can! Simply swipe on an Action Name and you'll see buttons that allow you to rename, add, or delete. Very simple and very effective.

This version also makes the move to iOS 9. The app no longer supports, nor can it be run on, any iPhone or iPad lower than iOS 9. Our analytics tell us that almost 100% of our users are already on iOS 9. If you're not on iOS 9, you need to be to run this version. This had to be done to take advantage of the exciting new features that Apple has built-in to the system.

Thank you to all our customers who sent us feedback within the app. It's because of you that development of VBall ScoreMaster continues while other scoring apps have been abandoned long ago.

Don't forget that every new version pushes existing reviews into the background. Please help others find this app, just like you did, by leaving a review. If you support or have questions, please don't leave that in a review, contact BaraLabs using 'Contact the Developer' on the Support screen in the app.

BaraLabs continues to listen to you, our customers!

# **Version 3.2**
Mar 23, 2015
Every new release pushes your previous reviews into the background (thanks Apple!) so please take some time to review the app. Your review will help countless others and it only takes a few minutes of your time. We read every review and take your feedback seriously.

BaraLabs continues to listen to you, our customers! This release adds color selection to the team score background! You've asked for it and we're glad we can deliver it to you.

Here's a list of what's changed with this update:
- Add the ability to customize background score colors
- Updated to the latest and greatest flat colors
- Removed long-press from Action Name Numbers on the iPhone & iPod only. This is due to issues with getting it to recognize the 'reset to 0' function. We'll work hard to get this feature back to you in future builds. This feature will still work on the iPad.
- Several small bugs were hunted down and eradicated without mercy
